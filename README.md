# university-db

This is an SQL project intended for the university for learning purposes.

The project consists of representing some important data of a university in a structured and organized way, possibly to lay a foundation for building an interactive website for current students and prospective students to use, but also for the purpose of storing and analysing our data or automating the generation of new data. 

The project contains a DDL, DML, SQL queries, procedures, functions and triggers, all containing explanatory comments, as well as a software engineering [project report](./report.pdf). DDL, DML and some sql queries are from the Introduction to Databases lectures from TU MÃ¼nchen.
